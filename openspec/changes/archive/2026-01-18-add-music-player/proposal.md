# Change: Add Music Player Web App

## Why
Users need a simple, beautiful music player that works well on iPhone. The TuneHub API provides access to multiple Chinese music platforms, but there's no mobile-optimized frontend to use it.

## What Changes
- Create a Next.js web application optimized for iPhone
- Implement search functionality (aggregate search across platforms)
- Build a beautiful, modern player UI with glassmorphism design
- Add random playback from toplists
- Configure for Vercel deployment
- Add API proxy to handle CORS

## Impact
- Affected specs: music-player (new capability)
- Affected code: New Next.js project in root directory
